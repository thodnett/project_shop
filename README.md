* Used Travis CI to continuously monitor and test code.
* Had family and friends test the app on various sized devices to ensure they are responsive.

# Deployment

* I used Github for version control throughout the creation of the project.

* Heroku -  https://tanias-shop.herokuapp.com/
* I deployed to Heroku by connecting to my Git master branch, so each time I pushed my code to Git it deployed to Heroku.
